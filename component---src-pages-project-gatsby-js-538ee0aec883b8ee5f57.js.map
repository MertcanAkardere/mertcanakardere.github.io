Gatsby is powered by React, HTML, SASS and GraphQL.

PWAs have potential to be standard for start-ups for ease of user experience and cross-platform development(1) that is pivotal in a market that introduces new platforms and demands updates regularly.</p>\r\n    <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/chiv/image/upload/v1570524145/projects/gatsby/pwa_etvczc.png\" alt=\"slide5\"></img>\r\n    <p>Good practices of web design are implemented to this site as I learn them. I use site metadata and helmet to keep the data centralized and keep the page speed high(2).
